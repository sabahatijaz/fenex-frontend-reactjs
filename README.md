## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

## Step 1: Install Node.js
The project requires Node.js version 20.18.0 or higher. You can install Node.js using the following command:

## For macOS and Linux:
If you use nvm (Node Version Manager), run:

bash
Copy code
nvm install 20.18.0
nvm use 20.18.0
If you donâ€™t have nvm installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the nvm GitHub repository.

## For Windows:
Download and install Node.js from the official Node.js website. Make sure to download the version that is 20.18.0 or higher.

Verify the installation by running:


###  `node -v`
This will display the installed Node.js version.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:


###  `git clone https://github.com/sabahatijaz/fenex-frontend-reactjs`


## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install all the necessary Node.js modules by running the following command:


###  cd fenex-quotationsystem
###  `npm install`
This command will install all dependencies defined in the package.json file, such as React, Axios, MUI, and others.

## Step 4: Run the Project
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the project in development mode by executing the following command:

###  `npm start`
This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000]. The page will automatically reload when you make any changes to the source code.






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
